### Use something fancy to make your CV

----------

I would suggest you to use [this FANCY thing here](https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume)

If you are still reading this the odds are you have not clicked on the [this FANCY thing here](https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume)
                                                   
So, let me tell you about it.. Fancy thing is actually **json_resume** it will get your resume translated from **JSON** to **HTML** (with templates), markdown, and etc.. 

json_resume is written in ruby and that is why I decided to try it.
                                                   
This library gives you number of posibilities for file version of your resume:

 - create **HTML** 
 - create **Markdown**
 - create **LaTex**
 - create **PDF** from **HTML**
 - create **PDF** from **LaTex** 
 - create **Markdown** version

#### Support for foreign languages (***i18n Support***)

Currently supports:

 - **English** (en) 
 - **Spanish** (es) 
 - **Finnish** (fi) 
 - **Portuguese** (pt)
