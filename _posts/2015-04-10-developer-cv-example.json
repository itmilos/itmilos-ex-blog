#### Use something fancy to make your CV

I would suggest you to use [THIS FANCY THING HERE](https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume)

If you are still reading this the odds are you have not clicked on the [THIS FANCY THING HERE](https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume)
                                                   
So, let me tell you about it.. Fancy thing is actually json_resume it will get your resume translated from JSON to html (with templates), markdown, and etc.. 

json_resume is written in ruby and that is why I decided to try it.
